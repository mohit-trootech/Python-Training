"""
This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms.
Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 (defined in FIPS 180-2)
as well as RSAâ€™s MD5 algorithm
RSA: Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, MD5: Message Digest 5 Algo
FIPS: Federal Information Processing Standard, SHA: Secure Hash Algorithm
